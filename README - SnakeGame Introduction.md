Goal: This project aims to re-make the famous snake game with some add-ons in terms of the game logic and gameplays to make it more interesting.

Gameplay: This gameplay variant is a 2-players game: There are 2 snakes in a limited space. Each player attempts to attempt to eat **the food** by running into 
them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult. Additionally,
each player needs to avoid collision with the other's snake body and with the space borders to not die. The difficulty is increased when the **the food** can move.
However, it can only move in a short amount of time and need to take a break to recharge energy. Each player will have to time this break to be able to eat food.
Unfortunately, this is not the only challenge that players have to face. There is another obstacle in my version -  a black hole that can move randomly inside the playing
space. Its size will be increased every time a player's snake eats the food. If the head of the snake collides with the blackhole, the player will lose.
