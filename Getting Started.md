# Getting started

1. What did you need to do to install the language?
    
    Installing the Live Server on VSC
    
2. Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you'll be using?
    
    I found the link that suggests 15 IDE suit best for Javascript, then I pick the one that I already familiar with which is Visual Studio Code
    
3. How do you run programs in that language?
    
    2 ways:
    
    - Include it inside a script element inside an HTML document and run it using Live Server extension.
    - Put it inside an external JavaScript file (.js) then reference it inside the HTML document using an empty script element with a src attribute.
4. How do you write comments in your language?
    
    Using two forward slashes //
